* Version 1.0:
. some tweaking to the monitoring code to make the script behave better in amarok 2.4.

* Version 0.9:
. monitor track changes, so that skipping the last track on a playlist will also make the script load a new album. Suggested by kronos003 (irc.freenode.net).

* Version 0.8:
. add support for genre filtering (contributed by Ghislain Mary)


* Version 0.7:
. minor update to work around an issue where playback wouldn't start when loading a new album. Delay the start of the playback a little to let amarok's UI properly refresh.


* Version 0.6:
. persist the list of played albums so that the same album isn't played after restarting amarok.
. if running in amarok 2.3.1, respect the "stop playing after current track" setting.


* Version 0.5:
. fix an issue with path filtering not doing what it was supposed to do in some cases
. remove some code that caused the script to freak out when stopping playback when the last track of a playlist was active.


* Version 0.4:
. Reworked the SQL queries; they should work better on databases that did not look like mine.
. Added option to filter the albums being loaded according to a string (matched against the album path).


* Version 0.3:
. Add new action to enable / disable the playlist monitor.


* Version 0.2:
. Updated to work with amarok 2.1. Hasn't been tested with 2.0.2...


* Version 0.1:
Initial version. What works:
. loading and enqueueing a random album.

Known issues:
. the playlist sometimes doesn't repaint correctly after an update. Clicking somewhere on the playlist fixes it (looks like an Amarok problem).
. only tested on my setup, so I don't know how it will work with collections spanning different devices, etc.
